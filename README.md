Employee turnover

Project Overview

The project involved the building of a model and analysis of employee data provided by HR at a company. This was to understand and predict what might lead an employee to resign. By doing so, it becomes possible to identify the underlying factors contributing to their departure. Given the substantial time and financial resources required to recruit, interview, and onboard new personnel, enhancing employee retention presents a valuable advantage to the company.

Data Understanding 

The data used was: satisfaction level, last performance review, number of projects worked, average monthly working hours, how long they have been employed, any work accidents, whether they have left or not, any promotions within the last 5 years, which department and their salary. 

Modeling and Evaluation 

We utilised the machine learning model of decision tree and random forest to determine a model that predicts the cause of leaving

Conclusion

The department did not influence their decision to leave. What seemed to cause the most turnover was the last evaluation and number of projects assigned (determined from the model). 

The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. 

To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

* Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
* Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
* Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so. 
* If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
* Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
* High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
